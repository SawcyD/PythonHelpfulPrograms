# Python Helpful Programs
This Git repository contains a collection of helpful Python programs for various tasks. These programs are designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and easy to use.

## Programs
Video Converter
The video converter program allows users to convert one video format to another using the MoviePy library. The GUI is built using the Tkinter library, making it easy to select the input file, output format, and output location. The program also displays a progress bar during the conversion process.

## Topic Sentence Finder
The topic sentence finder program analyzes a given text and identifies the topic sentence for each paragraph. The program uses natural language processing techniques to identify the main idea of each paragraph and return it to the user.

## Text-to-Speech
The text-to-speech program converts text input into speech output using the pyttsx3 library. The program allows users to adjust the speaking rate and volume, as well as save the speech output as an audio file.

## Image Recognition App
The image recognition app uses machine learning to identify objects within an image. The program leverages the power of the TensorFlow library and a pre-trained image recognition model to classify the image and return a list of identified objects.

## Calendar App (WIP)
The calendar app is a work-in-progress program that will allow users to manage their schedules and appointments. The program will include features such as adding, deleting, and modifying appointments, as well as providing reminders and notifications.

Usage
To use these programs, simply clone the repository and run the desired Python file in your terminal or IDE. Each program includes a README file with detailed usage instructions.
